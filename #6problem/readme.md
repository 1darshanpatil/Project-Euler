### Problem #6

[Problem #6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
   $$\begin{align}
       1^2 + 2^2 +... + 10^2 = 385
   \end{align}$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$\begin{align}
(1+2+....+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
\end{align}$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
